The concept of current selection is different than focus. Row or item can be selected even they don't have focus.

For a none @B_android#support#v17#leanback#widget#ListRow_E@ case, parameter item is always null. Event is fired when selection changes between rows, regardless if row view has focus or not. For a @B_android#support#v17#leanback#widget#ListRow_E@ case, parameter item can be null if the list row is empty. In the case of a grid, the row parameter is always null.
