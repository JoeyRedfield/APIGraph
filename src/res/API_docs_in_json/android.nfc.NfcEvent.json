{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.nfc.NfcEvent", "ClassDesc": "Wraps information associated with any NFC event. Immutable object, with direct access to the (final) fields. An @B_android#nfc#NfcEvent_E@ object is usually included in callbacks from @B_android#nfc#NfcAdapter_E@. Check the documentation of the callback to see which fields may be set. This wrapper object is used (instead of parameters in the callback) because it allows new fields to be added without breaking API compatibility."}
