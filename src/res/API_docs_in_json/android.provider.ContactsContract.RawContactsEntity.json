{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.provider.ContactsContract.RawContactsEntity", "ClassDesc": "Constants for the raw contacts entities table, which can be thought of as an outer join of the raw_contacts table with the data table. It is a strictly read-only table. If a raw contact has data rows, the RawContactsEntity cursor will contain a one row for each data row. If the raw contact has no data rows, the cursor will still contain one row with the raw contact-level information and nulls for data columns."}
