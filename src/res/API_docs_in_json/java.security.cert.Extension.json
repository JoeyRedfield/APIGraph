Extensions provide a means of associating additional attributes with users or public keys and for managing a certification hierarchy. The extension format also allows communities to define private extensions to carry information unique to those communities. Each extension contains an object identifier, a criticality setting indicating whether it is a critical or a non-critical extension, and and an ASN.1 DER-encoded value. Its ASN.1 definition is: This interface is designed to provide access to a single extension, unlike @B_java#security#cert#X509Extension_E@ which is more suitable for accessing a set of extensions."}
