{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.support.v4.view.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener", "ClassDesc": "Listener for applying window insets on a view in a custom way. Apps may choose to implement this interface if they want to apply custom policy to the way that window insets are treated for a view. If an OnApplyWindowInsetsListener is set, its @B_android#support#v4#view#OnApplyWindowInsetsListener#onApplyWindowInsets_E@ method will be called instead of the View's own onApplyWindowInsets method. The listener may optionally call the parameter View's onApplyWindowInsets method to apply the View's normal behavior as part of its own."}
