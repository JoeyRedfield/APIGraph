The precise meaning of \"copy\" may depend on the class of the object. The general intent is that, for any object x, the expression: true, but these are not absolute requirements. While it is typically the case that: true, this is not an absolute requirement. By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling super.clone. If a class and all of its superclasses (except Object) obey this convention, it will be the case that x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass(). By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent of this object (which is being cloned). To achieve this independence, it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by super.clone before returning it. Typically, this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal \"deep structure\" of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the copies. If a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by super.clone need to be modified. The method clone for class Object performs a specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does not implement the interface Cloneable, then a CloneNotSupportedException is thrown. Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface Cloneable and that the return type of the clone method of an array type T[] is T[] where T is any reference or primitive type. Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned.

Unlike a normal array of Objects, there can be gaps in the indices. It is intended to be more memory efficient than using a HashMap to map Longs to Objects, both because it avoids auto-boxing keys and its data structure doesn't rely on an extra entry object for each mapping. Note that this container keeps its mappings in an array data structure, using a binary search to find keys. The implementation is not intended to be appropriate for data structures that may contain large numbers of items. It is generally slower than a traditional HashMap, since lookups require a binary search and adds and removes require inserting and deleting entries in the array. For containers holding up to hundreds of items, the performance difference is not significant, less than 50%. To help with performance, the container includes an optimization when removing keys: instead of compacting its array immediately, it leaves the removed entry marked as deleted. The entry can then be re-used for the same key, or compacted later in a single garbage collection step of all removed entries. This garbage collection will need to be performed at any time the array needs to be grown or the the map size or entry values are retrieved. It is possible to iterate over the items in this container using @B_android#util#LongSparseArray#keyAt_E@ and @B_android#util#LongSparseArray#valueAt_E@. Iterating over the keys using keyAt(int) with ascending values of the index will return the keys in ascending order, or the values corresponding to the keys in ascending order in the case of valueAt(int)."}
