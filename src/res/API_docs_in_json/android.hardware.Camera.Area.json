The Area class is used for choosing specific metering and focus areas for the camera to use when calculating auto-exposure, auto-white balance, and auto-focus. To find out how many simultaneous areas a given camera supports, use @B_android#hardware#Camera#Parameters#getMaxNumMeteringAreas_E@ and @B_android#hardware#Camera#Parameters#getMaxNumFocusAreas_E@. If metering or focusing area selection is unsupported, these methods will return 0. Each Area consists of a rectangle specifying its bounds, and a weight that determines its importance. The bounds are relative to the camera's current field of view. The coordinates are mapped so that (-1000, -1000) is always the top-left corner of the current field of view, and (1000, 1000) is always the bottom-right corner of the current field of view. Setting Areas with bounds outside that range is not allowed. Areas with zero or negative width or height are not allowed. The weight must range from 1 to 1000, and represents a weight for every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area with the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in the metering result. Metering areas can overlap and the driver will add the weights in the overlap region."}
