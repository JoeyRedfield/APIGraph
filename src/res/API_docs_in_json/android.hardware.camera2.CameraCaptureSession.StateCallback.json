Pending capture requests exist in one of two queues: the in-flight queue where requests are already in different stages of processing pipeline, and an input queue where requests wait to enter the in-flight queue. The input queue is needed because more requests may be submitted than the current camera device pipeline depth. This callback is fired when the input queue becomes empty, and the camera device may have to fall back to the repeating request if set, or completely skip the next frame from the sensor. This can cause glitches to camera preview output, for example. This callback will only fire after requests queued by capture() or captureBurst(), not after a repeating request or burst enters the in-flight queue. For example, in the common case of a repeating request and a single-shot JPEG capture, this callback only fires when the JPEG request has entered the in-flight queue for capture. By only sending a new @B_android#hardware#camera2#CameraCaptureSession#capture_E@ or @B_android#hardware#camera2#CameraCaptureSession#captureBurst_E@ when the input queue is empty, pipeline latency can be minimized.
