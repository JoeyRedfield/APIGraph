When @B_android#support#v7#widget#RecyclerView#Recycler#getViewForPosition_E@ is called, Recycler checks attached scrap and first level cache to find a matching View. If it cannot find a suitable View, Recycler will call the @B_android#support#v7#widget#RecyclerView#ViewCacheExtension#getViewForPositionAndType_E@ before checking @B_android#support#v7#widget#RecyclerView#RecycledViewPool_E@. Note that, Recycler never sends Views to this method to be cached. It is developers responsibility to decide whether they want to keep their Views in this custom cache or let the default recycling policy handle it."}
