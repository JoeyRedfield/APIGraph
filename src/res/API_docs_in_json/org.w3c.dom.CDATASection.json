{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "org.w3c.dom.CDATASection", "ClassDesc": "CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters that would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is recognized in a CDATA section is the \"]]>\" string that ends the CDATA section. CDATA sections cannot be nested. Their primary purpose is for including material such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all the delimiters. The CharacterData.data attribute holds the text that is contained by the CDATA section. Note that this may contain characters that need to be escaped outside of CDATA sections and that, depending on the character encoding (\"charset\") chosen for serialization, it may be impossible to write out some characters as part of a CDATA section. The CDATASection interface inherits from the CharacterData interface through the Text interface. Adjacent CDATASection nodes are not merged by use of the normalize method of the Node interface. No lexical check is done on the content of a CDATA section and it is therefore possible to have the character sequence \"]]>\" in the content, which is illegal in a CDATA section per section 2.7 of [\"split-cdata-sections\" in the DOMConfiguration interface). CDATASection, character numeric references cannot be used as an escape mechanism when serializing. Therefore, action needs to be taken when serializing a CDATASection with a character encoding where some of the contained characters cannot be represented. Failure to do so would not produce well-formed XML. See also the"}
