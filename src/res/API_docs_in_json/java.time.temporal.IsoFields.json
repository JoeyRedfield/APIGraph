The complete date is expressed using three fields: @B_java#time#temporal#IsoFields#DAY_OF_QUARTER_E@ - the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92 @B_java#time#temporal#IsoFields#QUARTER_OF_YEAR_E@ - the week within the week-based-year @B_java#time#temporal#ChronoField#YEAR_E@ - the standard ISO year The date is expressed using three fields: @B_java#time#temporal#ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK_E@ - the standard field defining the day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7) @B_java#time#temporal#IsoFields#WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR_E@ - the week within the week-based-year @B_java#time#temporal#IsoFields#WEEK_BASED_YEAR_E@ - the week-based-year The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year. It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday. The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.
