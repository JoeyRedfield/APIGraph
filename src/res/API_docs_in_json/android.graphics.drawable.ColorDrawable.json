A TRANSPARENT drawable is one that draws nothing within its bounds, allowing everything behind it to show through.

If the visibility of the drawable's contents cannot be determined, the safest/best return value is TRANSLUCENT. Generally a Drawable should be as conservative as possible with the value it returns.
