In this case the default behaviour is to expect that the matcher matches 1 and only one item within the RecyclerView. This interface gives users the ability to override that type of behaviour and explicitly select an item in the RecyclerView at a given position. This is similar to on the onData(...).atPosition() api for AdapterViews."}
