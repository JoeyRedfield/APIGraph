Apps may choose to implement this interface if they want to apply custom policy to the way that window insets are treated for a view. If an OnApplyWindowInsetsListener is set, its @B_android#view#View#OnApplyWindowInsetsListener#onApplyWindowInsets_E@ method will be called instead of the View's own @B_android#view#View#onApplyWindowInsets_E@ method. The listener may optionally call the parameter View's onApplyWindowInsets method to apply the View's normal behavior as part of its own."}
