The naming convention follows. For numeric types it is FLOAT, SIGNED, or UNSIGNED followed by the _BITS where BITS is the size of the data. BOOLEAN is a true / false (1,0) represented in an 8 bit container. The UNSIGNED variants with multiple bit definitions are for packed graphical data formats and represent vectors with per vector member sizes which are treated as a single unit for packing and alignment purposes. MATRIX the three matrix types contain FLOAT_32 elements and are treated as 32 bits for alignment purposes. RS_* objects: opaque handles with implementation dependent sizes."}
