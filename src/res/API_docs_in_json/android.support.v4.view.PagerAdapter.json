You will most likely want to use a more specific implementation of this, such as @B_android#support#v4#app#FragmentPagerAdapter_E@ or @B_android#support#v4#app#FragmentStatePagerAdapter_E@. When you implement a PagerAdapter, you must override the following methods at minimum: @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#instantiateItem_E@ @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#destroyItem_E@ @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#getCount_E@ @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#isViewFromObject_E@ PagerAdapter is more general than the adapters used for https:##developer#android#com@B_android#widget#AdapterView_E@. Instead of providing a View recycling mechanism directly ViewPager uses callbacks to indicate the steps taken during an update. A PagerAdapter may implement a form of View recycling if desired or use a more sophisticated method of managing page Views such as Fragment transactions where each page is represented by its own Fragment. ViewPager associates each page with a key Object instead of working with Views directly. This key is used to track and uniquely identify a given page independent of its position in the adapter. A call to the PagerAdapter method @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#startUpdate_E@ indicates that the contents of the ViewPager are about to change. One or more calls to @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#instantiateItem_E@ and/or @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#destroyItem_E@ will follow, and the end of an update will be signaled by a call to @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#finishUpdate_E@. By the time @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#finishUpdate_E@ returns the views associated with the key objects returned by @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#instantiateItem_E@ should be added to the parent ViewGroup passed to these methods and the views associated with the keys passed to @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#destroyItem_E@ should be removed. The method @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#isViewFromObject_E@ identifies whether a page View is associated with a given key object. A very simple PagerAdapter may choose to use the page Views themselves as key objects, returning them from @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#instantiateItem_E@ after creation and adding them to the parent ViewGroup. A matching @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#destroyItem_E@ implementation would remove the View from the parent ViewGroup and @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#isViewFromObject_E@ could be implemented as return view == object;. PagerAdapter supports data set changes. Data set changes must occur on the main thread and must end with a call to @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#notifyDataSetChanged_E@ similar to AdapterView adapters derived from https:##developer#android#com@B_android#widget#BaseAdapter_E@. A data set change may involve pages being added, removed, or changing position. The ViewPager will keep the current page active provided the adapter implements the method @B_android#support#v4#view#PagerAdapter#getItemPosition_E@."}
