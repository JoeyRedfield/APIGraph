A stage completes upon termination of its computation, but this may in turn trigger other dependent stages. The functionality defined in this interface takes only a few basic forms, which expand out to a larger set of methods to capture a range of usage styles: The computation performed by a stage may be expressed as a Function, Consumer, or Runnable (using methods with names including apply, accept, or run, respectively) depending on whether it requires arguments and/or produces results. For example: compose) allows the construction of computation pipelines from functions returning completion stages. Any argument to a stage's computation is the outcome of a triggering stage's computation. One stage's execution may be triggered by completion of a single stage, or both of two stages, or either of two stages. Dependencies on a single stage are arranged using methods with prefix then. Those triggered by completion of both of two stages may combine their results or effects, using correspondingly named methods. Those triggered by either of two stages make no guarantees about which of the results or effects are used for the dependent stage's computation. Dependencies among stages control the triggering of computations, but do not otherwise guarantee any particular ordering. Additionally, execution of a new stage's computations may be arranged in any of three ways: default execution, default asynchronous execution (using methods with suffix async that employ the stage's default asynchronous execution facility), or custom (via a supplied @B_java#util#concurrent#Executor_E@). The execution properties of default and async modes are specified by CompletionStage implementations, not this interface. Methods with explicit Executor arguments may have arbitrary execution properties, and might not even support concurrent execution, but are arranged for processing in a way that accommodates asynchrony. Two method forms (@B_java#util#concurrent#CompletionStage#handle_E@ and @B_java#util#concurrent#CompletionStage#whenComplete_E@) support unconditional computation whether the triggering stage completed normally or exceptionally. Method @B_java#util#concurrent#CompletionStage#exceptionally_E@ supports computation only when the triggering stage completes exceptionally, computing a replacement result, similarly to the java catch keyword. In all other cases, if a stage's computation terminates abruptly with an (unchecked) exception or error, then all dependent stages requiring its completion complete exceptionally as well, with a @B_java#util#concurrent#CompletionException_E@ holding the exception as its cause. If a stage is dependent on both of two stages, and both complete exceptionally, then the CompletionException may correspond to either one of these exceptions. If a stage is dependent on either of two others, and only one of them completes exceptionally, no guarantees are made about whether the dependent stage completes normally or exceptionally. In the case of method whenComplete, when the supplied action itself encounters an exception, then the stage completes exceptionally with this exception unless the source stage also completed exceptionally, in which case the exceptional completion from the source stage is given preference and propagated to the dependent stage. All methods adhere to the above triggering, execution, and exceptional completion specifications (which are not repeated in individual method specifications). Additionally, while arguments used to pass a completion result (that is, for parameters of type T) for methods accepting them may be null, passing a null value for any other parameter will result in a @B_java#lang#NullPointerException_E@ being thrown. Method form @B_java#util#concurrent#CompletionStage#handle_E@ is the most general way of creating a continuation stage, unconditionally performing a computation that is given both the result and exception (if any) of the triggering CompletionStage, and computing an arbitrary result. Method @B_java#util#concurrent#CompletionStage#whenComplete_E@ is similar, but preserves the result of the triggering stage instead of computing a new one. Because a stage's normal result may be null, both methods should have a computation structured thus: This interface does not define methods for initially creating, forcibly completing normally or exceptionally, probing completion status or results, or awaiting completion of a stage. Implementations of CompletionStage may provide means of achieving such effects, as appropriate. Method @B_java#util#concurrent#CompletionStage#toCompletableFuture_E@ enables interoperability among different implementations of this interface by providing a common conversion type."}
