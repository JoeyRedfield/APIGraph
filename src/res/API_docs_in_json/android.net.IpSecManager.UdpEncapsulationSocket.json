In general, the toString method returns a string that \"textually represents\" this object. The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read.

UdpEncapsulationSocket wraps a system-provided datagram socket intended for IKEv2 signalling and UDP encapsulated IPsec traffic. Instances can be obtained by calling @B_android#net#IpSecManager#openUdpEncapsulationSocket_E@. The provided socket cannot be re-bound by the caller. The caller should not close the FileDescriptor returned by @B_android#net#IpSecManager#UdpEncapsulationSocket#getFileDescriptor_E@, but should use @B_android#net#IpSecManager#UdpEncapsulationSocket#close_E@ instead. Allowing the user to close or unbind a UDP encapsulation socket could impact the traffic of the next user who binds to that port. To prevent this scenario, these sockets are held open by the system so that they may only be closed by calling @B_android#net#IpSecManager#UdpEncapsulationSocket#close_E@ or when the user process exits."}
