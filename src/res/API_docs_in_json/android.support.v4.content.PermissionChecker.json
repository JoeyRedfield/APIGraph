{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": ["java.lang.Object"], "ClassName": "android.support.v4.content.PermissionChecker", "ClassDesc": "This class provides permission check APIs that verify both the permission and the associated app op for this permission if such is defined. In the new permission model permissions with protection level dangerous are runtime permissions. For apps targeting https:##developer#android#com@B_android#os#Build#VERSION_CODES#M_E@ and above the user may not grant such permissions or revoke them at any time. For apps targeting API lower than https:##developer#android#com@B_android#os#Build#VERSION_CODES#M_E@ these permissions are always granted as such apps do not expect permission revocations and would crash. Therefore, when the user disables a permission for a legacy app in the UI the platform disables the APIs guarded by this permission making them a no-op which is doing nothing or returning an empty result or default error. It is important that when you perform an operation on behalf of another app you use these APIs to check for permissions as the app may be a legacy app that does not participate in the new permission model for which the user had disabled the \"permission\" which is achieved by disallowing the corresponding app op."}
