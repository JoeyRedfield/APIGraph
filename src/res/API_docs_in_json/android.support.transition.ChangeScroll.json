When any transition is started on a given scene root, all transitions currently running on that same scene root are checked to see whether the properties on which they based their animations agree with the end values of the same properties in the new transition. If the end values are not equal, then the old animation is canceled since the new transition will start a new animation to these new values. If the values are equal, the old animation is allowed to continue and no new animation is started for that transition. A transition does not need to override this method. However, not doing so will mean that the cancellation logic outlined in the previous paragraph will be skipped for that transition, possibly leading to artifacts as old transitions and new transitions on the same targets run in parallel, animating views toward potentially different end values.", "history": "added in version 26.0.0-beta2", "FullName": "String[] getTransitionProperties ()"}}, "Inheritance": ["java.lang.Object", "@B_android#support#transition#Transition_E@"], "ClassName": "android.support.transition.ChangeScroll", "ClassDesc": "This transition captures the scroll properties of targets before and after the scene change and animates any changes."}
