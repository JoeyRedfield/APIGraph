A RowSetEvent object is generated when a single row in a rowset is changed, the whole rowset is changed, or the rowset cursor moves. When an event occurs on a RowSet object, one of the RowSetListener methods will be sent to all registered listeners to notify them of the event. An Event object is supplied to the RowSetListener method so that the listener can use it to find out which RowSet object is the source of the event."}
