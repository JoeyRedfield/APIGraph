{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.speech.RecognizerResultsIntent", "ClassDesc": "Constants for intents related to showing speech recognition results. These constants should not be needed for normal utilization of speech recognition. They would only be called if you wanted to trigger a view of voice search results in your application, or implemented if you wanted to offer a different view for voice search results with your application. The standard behavior here for someone receiving an @B_android#speech#RecognizerResultsIntent#ACTION_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULTS_E@ is to first retrieve the list of @B_android#speech#RecognizerResultsIntent#EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_STRINGS_E@, and use any provided HTML for that result in @B_android#speech#RecognizerResultsIntent#EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_HTML_E@, if available, to display the search results. If that is not available, then the corresponding url for that result in @B_android#speech#RecognizerResultsIntent#EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_URLS_E@ should be used. And if even that is not available, then a search url should be constructed from the actual recognition result string."}
