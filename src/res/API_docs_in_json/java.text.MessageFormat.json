Use this to construct messages displayed for end users. MessageFormat takes a set of objects, formats them, then inserts the formatted strings into the pattern at the appropriate places. MessageFormat differs from the other Format classes in that you create a MessageFormat object with one of its constructors (not with a getInstance style factory method). The factory methods aren't necessary because MessageFormat itself doesn't implement locale specific behavior. Any locale specific behavior is defined by the pattern that you provide as well as the subformats used for inserted arguments. MessageFormat uses patterns of the following form: Within a \"'{0}'\" represents string \"{0}\", not a '' throughout a \"'{''}'\" is interpreted as a sequence of '{ (start of quoting and a left curly brace), '' (a single quote), and }' (a right curly brace and end of quoting), not '{' and '}' (quoted left and right curly braces): representing string \"{'}\", not \"{}\". A \"{1,number,$'#',##}\" (\"$#31,45\". Refer to each Format subclass documentation for details. Any unmatched quote is treated as closed at the end of the given pattern. For example, pattern string \"'{0}\" is treated as pattern \"'{0}'\". Any curly braces within an unquoted pattern must be balanced. For example, \"ab {0} de\" and \"ab '}' de\" are valid patterns, but \"ab {0'}' de\", \"ab } de\" and \"''{''\" are not. The '0' through '9', and represents an index into the arguments array passed to the format methods or the result array returned by the parse methods. The Format instance for the format element. The following table shows how the values map to Format instances. Combinations not shown in the table are illegal. A Format subclass used. Here are some examples of usage. In real internationalized programs, the message format pattern and other static strings will, of course, be obtained from resource bundles. Other parameters will be dynamically determined at runtime. The first example uses the static method MessageFormat.format, which internally creates a MessageFormat for one-time use: The following example creates a MessageFormat instance that can be used repeatedly: fileCount: For more sophisticated patterns, you can use a ChoiceFormat to produce correct forms for singular and plural: fileCount: You can create the ChoiceFormat programmatically, as in the above example, or by using a pattern. See @B_java#text#ChoiceFormat_E@ for more information. ChoiceFormat in MessageFormat is treated as special; occurrences of '{' are used to indicate subformats, and cause recursion. If you create both a MessageFormat and ChoiceFormat programmatically (instead of using the string patterns), then be careful not to produce a format that recurses on itself, which will cause an infinite loop. When a single argument is parsed more than once in the string, the last match will be the final result of the parsing. For example, Likewise, parsing with a MessageFormat object using patterns containing multiple occurrences of the same argument would return the last match. For example, Message formats are not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread. If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized externally."}
