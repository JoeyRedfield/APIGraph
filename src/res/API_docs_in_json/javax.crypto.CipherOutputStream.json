The cipher must be fully initialized before being used by a CipherOutputStream. For example, if the cipher is initialized for encryption, the CipherOutputStream will attempt to encrypt data before writing out the encrypted data. This class adheres strictly to the semantics, especially the failure semantics, of its ancestor classes java.io.OutputStream and java.io.FilterOutputStream. This class has exactly those methods specified in its ancestor classes, and overrides them all. Moreover, this class catches all exceptions that are not thrown by its ancestor classes. It is crucial for a programmer using this class not to use methods that are not defined or overriden in this class (such as a new method or constructor that is later added to one of the super classes), because the design and implementation of those methods are unlikely to have considered security impact with regard to CipherOutputStream."}
