If a SAX application needs to implement customized error handling, it must implement this interface and then register an instance with the XML reader using the @B_org#xml#sax#XMLReader#setErrorHandler_E@ method. The parser will then report all errors and warnings through this interface. not register an ErrorHandler, XML parsing errors will go unreported, except that SAXParseExceptions will be thrown for fatal errors. In order to detect validity errors, an ErrorHandler that does something with @B_org#xml#sax#ErrorHandler#error_E@ calls must be registered. For XML processing errors, a SAX driver must use this interface in preference to throwing an exception: it is up to the application to decide whether to throw an exception for different types of errors and warnings. Note, however, that there is no requirement that the parser continue to report additional errors after a call to @B_org#xml#sax#ErrorHandler#fatalError_E@. In other words, a SAX driver class may throw an exception after reporting any fatalError. Also parsers may throw appropriate exceptions for non-XML errors. For example, @B_org#xml#sax#XMLReader#parse_E@ would throw an IOException for errors accessing entities or the document."}
