Use this method to play a platform-specific sound for various media actions. The sound playback is done asynchronously, with the same behavior and content as the sounds played by @B_android#hardware#Camera#takePicture_E@, @B_android#media#MediaRecorder#start_E@, and @B_android#media#MediaRecorder#stop_E@. With the @B_android#hardware#camera2#package-summary_E@ API, this method can be used to play standard camera operation sounds with the appropriate system behavior for such sounds. With the older @B_android#hardware#Camera_E@ API, using this method makes it easy to match the default device sounds when recording or capturing data through the preview callbacks, or when implementing custom camera-like features in your application. If the sound has not been loaded by @B_android#media#MediaActionSound#load_E@ before calling play, play will load the sound at the cost of some additional latency before sound playback begins.", "history": "Added in API level 16", "FullName": "public void play (int soundName)"}}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.media.MediaActionSound", "ClassDesc": "A class for producing sounds that match those produced by various actions taken by the media and camera APIs. This class is recommended for use with the @B_android#hardware#camera2#package-summary_E@ API, since the camera2 API does not play any sounds on its own for any capture or video recording actions. With the older @B_android#hardware#Camera_E@ API, use this class to play an appropriate camera operation sound when implementing a custom still or video recording mechanism (through the Camera preview callbacks with @B_android#hardware#Camera#setPreviewCallback_E@, or through GPU processing with @B_android#hardware#Camera#setPreviewTexture_E@, for example), or when implementing some other camera-like function in your application. There is no need to play sounds when using @B_android#hardware#Camera#takePicture_E@ or @B_android#media#MediaRecorder_E@ for still images or video, respectively, as the Android framework will play the appropriate sounds when needed for these calls."}
