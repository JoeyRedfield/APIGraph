This pinning information can be used by individual applications to customize how they order particular pinned contacts. For example, a Dialer application could use pinned information to order user-pinned contacts in a top row of favorites. It is possible for two or more contacts to occupy the same pinned position (due to aggregation and sync), so this pinning information should be used on a best-effort basis to order contacts in-application rather than an absolute guide on where a contact should be positioned. Contacts returned by the ContactsProvider will not be ordered based on this information, so it is up to the client application to reorder these contacts within their own UI adhering to (or ignoring as appropriate) information stored in the pinned column. By default, unpinned contacts will have a pinned position of @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#PinnedPositions#UNPINNED_E@. Client-provided pinned positions can be positive integers that are greater than 1."}
