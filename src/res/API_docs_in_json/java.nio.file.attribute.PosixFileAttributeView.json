Operating systems that implement the owner, group-owner, and related access permissions. This file attribute view provides read and write access to these attributes. The @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributeView#readAttributes_E@ method is used to read the file's attributes. The file @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributes#owner_E@ is represented by a @B_java#nio#file#attribute#UserPrincipal_E@ that is the identity of the file owner for the purposes of access control. The @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributes#group_E@, represented by a @B_java#nio#file#attribute#GroupPrincipal_E@, is the identity of the group owner, where a group is an identity created for administrative purposes so as to determine the access rights for the members of the group. The @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributes#permissions_E@ attribute is a set of access permissions. This file attribute view provides access to the nine permission defined by the @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFilePermission_E@ class. These nine permission bits determine the read, write, and execute access for the file owner, group, and others (others meaning identities other than the owner and members of the group). Some operating systems and file systems may provide additional permission bits but access to these other bits is not defined by this class in this release. Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes supported by this attribute view are as defined by @B_java#nio#file#attribute#BasicFileAttributeView_E@ and @B_java#nio#file#attribute#FileOwnerAttributeView_E@, and in addition, the following attributes are supported: The @B_java#nio#file#Files#getAttribute_E@ method may be used to read any of these attributes, or any of the attributes defined by @B_java#nio#file#attribute#BasicFileAttributeView_E@ as if by invoking the @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributeView#readAttributes_E@ method. The @B_java#nio#file#Files#setAttribute_E@ method may be used to update the file's last modified time, last access time or create time attributes as defined by @B_java#nio#file#attribute#BasicFileAttributeView_E@. It may also be used to update the permissions, owner, or group-owner as if by invoking the @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributeView#setPermissions_E@, @B_java#nio#file#attribute#FileOwnerAttributeView#setOwner_E@, and @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributeView#setGroup_E@ methods respectively. Implementations supporting this attribute view may also support setting the initial permissions when creating a file or directory. The initial permissions are provided to the @B_java#nio#file#Files#createFile_E@ or @B_java#nio#file#Files#createDirectory_E@ methods as a @B_java#nio#file#attribute#FileAttribute_E@ with @B_java#nio#file#attribute#FileAttribute#name_E@ \"posix:permissions\" and a @B_java#nio#file#attribute#FileAttribute#value_E@ that is the set of permissions. The following example uses the @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFilePermissions#asFileAttribute_E@ method to construct a FileAttribute when creating a file: When the access permissions are set at file creation time then the actual value of the permissions may differ that the value of the attribute object. The reasons for this are implementation specific. On UNIX systems, for example, a process has a umask that impacts the permission bits of newly created files. Where an implementation supports the setting of the access permissions, and the underlying file system supports access permissions, then it is required that the value of the actual access permissions will be equal or less than the value of the attribute provided to the @B_java#nio#file#Files#createFile_E@ or @B_java#nio#file#Files#createDirectory_E@ methods. In other words, the file may be more secure than requested."}
