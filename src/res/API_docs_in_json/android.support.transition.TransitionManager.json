To use the manager, add scenes along with transition objects with calls to @B_android#support#transition#TransitionManager#setTransition_E@ or @B_android#support#transition#TransitionManager#setTransition_E@. Setting specific transitions for scene changes is not required; by default, a Scene change will use @B_android#support#transition#AutoTransition_E@ to do something reasonable for most situations. Specifying other transitions for particular scene changes is only necessary if the application wants different transition behavior in these situations. TransitionManagers can be declared in XML resource files inside the res/transition directory. TransitionManager resources consist of the transitionManagertag name, containing one or more transition tags, each of which describe the relationship of that transition to the from/to scene information in that tag. For example, here is a resource file that declares several scene transitions: For each of the fromScene and toScene attributes, there is a reference to a standard XML layout file. This is equivalent to creating a scene from a layout in code by calling @B_android#support#transition#Scene#getSceneForLayout_E@. For the transition attribute, there is a reference to a resource file in the res/transition directory which describes that transition."}
