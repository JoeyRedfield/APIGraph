These constants define extras that can be added to a http:##developer#android#com@B_android#media#session#MediaSession_E@, or to custom actions within a session, to customise the appearance and functions of the associated media controls on Wear. These extras can be added to either a session on the companion device (to affect the media controls that appear on Wear automatically) or a session created on the wearable itself (to affect media controls that appear when the app creates a http:##developer#android#com@B_android#app#Notification#MediaStyle_E@ notification). For example, to create a custom action that will appear on Wear: That custom action will appear after the standard media controls as a notification-style action, unless there is a space on the four-way controls because either skip-next or skip-previous are not supported. If you do not want the custom action to appear on the four-way controls, you can reserve the left and right spaces on those controls to be for skip-previous and skip-next only by setting extras on the session as in this example:"}
