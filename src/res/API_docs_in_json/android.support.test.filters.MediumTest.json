{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.support.test.filters.MediumTest", "ClassDesc": "Annotation to assign a medium test size qualifier to a test. This annotation can be used at a method or class level. Test size qualifiers are a great way to structure test code and are used to assign a test to a test suite of similar run time. Execution time: <1000ms Medium tests should be focused on a very limited subset of components or a single component. Resource access to the file system through well defined interfaces like databases, ContentProviders, or Context is permitted. Network access should be restricted, (long-running) blocking operations should be avoided and use mock objects instead. Note: This class replaces the deprecated Android platform size qualifier"}
