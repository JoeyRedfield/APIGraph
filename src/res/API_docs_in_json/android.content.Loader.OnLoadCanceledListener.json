You do not normally need to implement this yourself; it is used in the implementation of @B_android#app#LoaderManager_E@ to find out when a Loader it is managing has been canceled so that it can schedule the next Loader. This interface should only be used if a Loader is not being used in conjunction with LoaderManager."}
