The following shows how to replicate the functionality of percentage layouts with a ConstraintLayout. The Guidelines are used to define each percentage break point, and then a Button view is stretched to fill the gap: layout_widthPercent layout_heightPercent layout_marginPercent layout_marginLeftPercent layout_marginTopPercent layout_marginRightPercent layout_marginBottomPercent layout_marginStartPercent layout_marginEndPercent layout_aspectRatio It is not necessary to specify layout_width/height if you specify layout_widthPercent. However, if you want the view to be able to take up more space than what percentage value permits, you can add layout_width/height=\"wrap_content\". In that case if the percentage size is too small for the View's content, it will be resized using wrap_content rule. You can also make one dimension be a fraction of the other by setting only width or height and using layout_aspectRatio for the second one to be calculated automatically. For example, if you would like to achieve 16:9 aspect ratio, you can write:"}
