{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.hardware.SensorEvent", "ClassDesc": "This class represents a @B_android#hardware#Sensor_E@ event and holds information such as the sensor's type, the time-stamp, accuracy and of course the sensor's @B_android#hardware#SensorEvent#values_E@. The coordinate-system is defined relative to the screen of the phone in its default orientation. The axes are not swapped when the device's screen orientation changes. The X axis is horizontal and points to the right, the Y axis is vertical and points up and the Z axis points towards the outside of the front face of the screen. In this system, coordinates behind the screen have negative Z values."}
