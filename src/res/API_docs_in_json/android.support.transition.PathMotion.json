Transitions such as https:##developer#android#com@B_android#transition#ChangeBounds_E@ move Views, typically in a straight path between the start and end positions. Applications that desire to have these motions move in a curve can change how Views interpolate in two dimensions by extending PathMotion and implementing @B_android#support#transition#PathMotion#getPath_E@. This may be used in XML as an element inside a transition."}
