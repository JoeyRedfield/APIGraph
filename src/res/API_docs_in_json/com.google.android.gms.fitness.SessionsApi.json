Sessions are a way of storing user-visible groups of related stream data in a useful and shareable manner, and allow for easy querying of the data in a detailed or aggregated fashion. The @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#SessionsApi#startSession_E@ and @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#SessionsApi#stopSession_E@ methods mark the time range of the session. Data inserted using the @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#HistoryApi_E@ during the period where the session is in progress will be associated with that Session once it is stopped. Another way of adding sessions is with @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#SessionsApi#insertSession_E@. This is designed for bulk insertion when importing a user's historic data into Google Fit; for live sessions use the previous API. All data in Google Fit that falls within the time range of an inserted session will be implicitly associated with that session. Once a session has been saved, it can be retrieved using @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#SessionsApi#readSession_E@. Clients can register to be notified of sessions, and remove existing registrations, using @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#SessionsApi#registerForSessions_E@ and @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#SessionsApi#unregisterForSessions_E@. Notifications will be sent for sessions when they are started and stopped. Deleting sessions is handled like any other data deletion, via @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#HistoryApi#deleteData_E@. The Sessions API should be accessed via the @B_com#google#android#gms#fitness#Fitness_E@ entry point. Example:"}
