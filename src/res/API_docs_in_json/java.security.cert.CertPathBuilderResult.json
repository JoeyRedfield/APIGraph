All results returned by the @B_java#security#cert#CertPathBuilder#build_E@ method must implement this interface. At a minimum, a CertPathBuilderResult contains the CertPath built by the CertPathBuilder instance. Implementations of this interface may add methods to return implementation or algorithm specific information, such as debugging information or certification path validation results. Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this interface are not thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize."}
