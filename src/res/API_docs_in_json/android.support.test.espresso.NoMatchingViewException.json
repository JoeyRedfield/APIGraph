Contains details about the matcher and the current view hierarchy to aid in debugging. Since this is usually an unrecoverable error this exception is a runtime exception. References to the view and failing matcher are purposefully not included in the state of this object - since it will most likely be created on the UI thread and thrown on the instrumentation thread, it would be invalid to touch the view on the instrumentation thread. Also the view hierarchy may have changed since exception creation (leading to more confusion)."}
