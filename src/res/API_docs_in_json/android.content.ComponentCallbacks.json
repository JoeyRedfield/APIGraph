That is, before reaching the point of killing processes hosting service and foreground UI that we would like to avoid killing. You should implement this method to release any caches or other unnecessary resources you may be holding on to. The system will perform a garbage collection for you after returning from this method. Preferably, you should implement @B_android#content#ComponentCallbacks2#onTrimMemory_E@ from @B_android#content#ComponentCallbacks2_E@ to incrementally unload your resources based on various levels of memory demands. That API is available for API level 14 and higher, so you should only use this @B_android#content#ComponentCallbacks#onLowMemory_E@ method as a fallback for older versions, which can be treated the same as @B_android#content#ComponentCallbacks2#onTrimMemory_E@ with the @B_android#content#ComponentCallbacks2#TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE_E@ level.", "history": "Added in API level 1", "FullName": "public abstract void onLowMemory ()"}}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.content.ComponentCallbacks", "ClassDesc": "The set of callback APIs that are common to all application components (@B_android#app#Activity_E@, @B_android#app#Service_E@, @B_android#content#ContentProvider_E@, and @B_android#app#Application_E@). @B_android#content#ComponentCallbacks2_E@ interface, which provides the @B_android#content#ComponentCallbacks2#onTrimMemory_E@ callback to help your app manage its memory usage more effectively."}
