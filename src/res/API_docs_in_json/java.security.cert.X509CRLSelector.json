This class is particularly useful when selecting CRLs from a CertStore to check revocation status of a particular certificate.

Therefore, the @B_java#security#cert#X509CRLSelector#match_E@ method would return true for any X509CRL. Typically, several criteria are enabled (by calling @B_java#security#cert#X509CRLSelector#setIssuers_E@ or @B_java#security#cert#X509CRLSelector#setDateAndTime_E@, for instance) and then the X509CRLSelector is passed to @B_java#security#cert#CertStore#getCRLs_E@ or some similar method. Please refer to Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize."}
