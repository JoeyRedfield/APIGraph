{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.provider.ContactsContract.Profile", "ClassDesc": "Constants for the user's profile data, which is represented as a single contact on the device that represents the user. The profile contact is not aggregated together automatically in the same way that normal contacts are; instead, each account (including data set, if applicable) on the device may contribute a single raw contact representing the user's personal profile data from that source. Access to the profile entry through these URIs (or incidental access to parts of the profile if retrieved directly via ID) requires additional permissions beyond the read/write contact permissions required by the provider. Querying for profile data requires android.permission.READ_PROFILE permission, and inserting or updating profile data requires android.permission.WRITE_PROFILE permission."}
