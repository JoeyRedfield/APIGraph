{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.drm.DrmStore.ConstraintsColumns", "ClassDesc": "Interface definition for the columns that represent DRM constraints. @B_android#drm#DrmManagerClient#getConstraints_E@ can be called by an application to find out the contraints on the @B_android#drm#DrmStore#Action_E@ that can be performed on right-protected content. The constants defined in this interface represent three most common types of constraints: count-based, date-based, and duration-based. Two or more constraints can be used at the same time to represent more sophisticated constraints. In addition, user-defined constraint, @B_android#drm#DrmStore#ConstraintsColumns#EXTENDED_METADATA_E@, can be used if these three types of constraints are not sufficient."}
