It is a data structure that contains several important pieces of data about the operation and the underlying data. View objects that receive a DragEvent call @B_android#view#DragEvent#getAction_E@, which returns an action type that indicates the state of the drag and drop operation. This allows a View object to react to a change in state by changing its appearance or performing other actions. For example, a View can react to the @B_android#view#DragEvent#ACTION_DRAG_ENTERED_E@ action type by by changing one or more colors in its displayed image. During a drag and drop operation, the system displays an image that the user drags. This image is called a drag shadow. Several action types reflect the position of the drag shadow relative to the View receiving the event. Most methods return valid data only for certain event actions. This is summarized in the following table. Each possible @B_android#view#DragEvent#getAction_E@ value is listed in the first column. The other columns indicate which method or methods return valid data for that getAction() value: The @B_android#view#DragEvent#getAction_E@, @B_android#view#DragEvent#getLocalState_E@ @B_android#view#DragEvent#describeContents_E@, @B_android#view#DragEvent#writeToParcel_E@, and @B_android#view#DragEvent#toString_E@ methods always return valid data."}
