A @B_android#support#v7#preference#PreferenceFragmentCompat_E@ points to an instance of this class to show the preferences. To instantiate this class, use @B_android#support#v7#preference#PreferenceManager#createPreferenceScreen_E@. This class can appear in two places: When a @B_android#support#v7#preference#PreferenceFragmentCompat_E@ points to this, it is used as the root and is not shown (only the contained preferences are shown). When it appears inside another preference hierarchy, it is shown and serves as the gateway to another screen of preferences (either by showing another screen of preferences as a https:##developer#android#com@B_android#app#Dialog_E@ or via a https:##developer#android#com@B_android#content#Context#startActivity_E@ from the @B_android#support#v7#preference#Preference#getIntent_E@). The children of this @B_android#support#v7#preference#PreferenceScreen_E@ are NOT shown in the screen that this @B_android#support#v7#preference#PreferenceScreen_E@ is shown in. Instead, a separate screen will be shown when this preference is clicked. Here's an example XML layout of a PreferenceScreen: In this example, the \"first_preferencescreen\" will be used as the root of the hierarchy and given to a @B_android#support#v14#preference#PreferenceFragment_E@ or @B_android#support#v7#preference#PreferenceFragmentCompat_E@. The first screen will show preferences \"WiFi\" (which can be used to quickly enable/disable WiFi) and \"WiFi settings\". The \"WiFi settings\" is the \"second_preferencescreen\" and when clicked will show another screen of preferences such as \"Prefer WiFi\" (and the other preferences that are children of the \"second_preferencescreen\" tag)."}
