An OPAQUE drawable is one that draws all all content within its bounds, completely covering anything behind the drawable. A TRANSPARENT drawable is one that draws nothing within its bounds, allowing everything behind it to show through. A TRANSLUCENT drawable is a drawable in any other state, where the drawable will draw some, but not all, of the content within its bounds and at least some content behind the drawable will be visible. If the visibility of the drawable's contents cannot be determined, the safest/best return value is TRANSLUCENT. Generally a Drawable should be as conservative as possible with the value it returns. For example, if it contains multiple child drawables and only shows one of them at a time, if only one of the children is TRANSLUCENT and the others are OPAQUE then TRANSLUCENT should be returned. You can use the method @B_android#graphics#drawable#Drawable#resolveOpacity_E@ to perform a standard reduction of two opacities to the appropriate single output. Note that the returned value does not necessarily take into account a custom alpha or color filter that has been applied by the client through the @B_android#graphics#drawable#Drawable#setAlpha_E@ or @B_android#graphics#drawable#Drawable#setColorFilter_E@ methods.
