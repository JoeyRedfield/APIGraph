This is part of the test framework public API - developers are free to write their own ViewAction implementations when necessary. When implementing a new ViewAction, follow these rules: Inject motion events or key events via the UiController to simulate user interactions. Do not mutate the view directly via setter methods and other state changing methods on the view parameter. Do not throw AssertionErrors. Assertions belong in ViewAssertion classes. View action code will executed on the UI thread, therefore you should not block, perform sleeps, or perform other expensive computations. The test framework will wait for the UI thread to be idle both before and after perform() is called. This means that the action is guaranteed to be synchronized with any other view operations. Downcasting the View object to an expected subtype is allowed, so long as the object expresses the subtype matches the constraints as specified in getConstraints."}
