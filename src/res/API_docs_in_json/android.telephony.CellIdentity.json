It is x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true.

For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false. The equals method for class Object implements the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects; that is, for any non-null reference values x and y, this method returns true if and only if x and y refer to the same object (x == y has the value true).

This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by @B_java#util#HashMap_E@. The general contract of hashCode is: Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the @B_java#lang#Object#equals_E@ method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables. As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects.
