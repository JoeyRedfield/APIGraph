The larger the value, the more consistent the data used to perform the classification is with the detected activity. This value will be <= 100. It means that larger values such as a confidence of >= 75 indicate that it's very likely that the detected activity is correct, while a value of <= 50 indicates that there may be another activity that is just as or more likely. Multiple activities may have high confidence values. For example, the ON_FOOT may have a confidence of 100 while the RUNNING activity may have a confidence of 95. The sum of the confidences of all detected activities for a classification does not have to be <= 100 since some activities are not mutually exclusive (for example, you can be walking while in a bus) and some activities are hierarchical (ON_FOOT is a generalization of WALKING and RUNNING).", "history": "", "FullName": "public int getConfidence ()"}, "describeContents()": {"Returns": [], "Parameters": [], "Throws": [], "SeeAlso": [], "Permissions": [], "Description": "", "history": "", "FullName": "public int describeContents ()"}}, "Inheritance": ["java.lang.Object"], "ClassName": "com.google.android.gms.location.DetectedActivity", "ClassDesc": "The detected activity of the device with an an associated confidence.
