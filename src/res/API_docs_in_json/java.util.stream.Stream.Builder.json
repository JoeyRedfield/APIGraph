This allows the creation of a Stream by generating elements individually and adding them to the Builder (without the copying overhead that comes from using an ArrayList as a temporary buffer.) A stream builder has a lifecycle, which starts in a building phase, during which elements can be added, and then transitions to a built phase, after which elements may not be added. The built phase begins when the @B_java#util#stream#Stream#Builder#build_E@ method is called, which creates an ordered Stream whose elements are the elements that were added to the stream builder, in the order they were added."}
