Third-party libraries are strongly encouraged to honor this setting as well. This flag is honored on a best effort basis because it's impossible to prevent all cleartext traffic from Android applications given the level of access provided to them. For example, there's no expectation that the @B_java#net#Socket_E@ API will honor this flag because it cannot determine whether its traffic is in cleartext. However, most network traffic from applications is handled by higher-level network stacks/components which can honor this aspect of the policy.
