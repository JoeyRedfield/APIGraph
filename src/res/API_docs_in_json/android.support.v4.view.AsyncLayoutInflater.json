{"Functions": {"AsyncLayoutInflater(android.content.Context)": {"Returns": [], "Parameters": [["@B_android#content#Context_E@", "Context no parameter comment"]], "Throws": [], "SeeAlso": [], "Permissions": [], "Description": "", "history": "added in version 24.0.0", "FullName": "AsyncLayoutInflater (Context context)"}}, "Inheritance": ["java.lang.Object"], "ClassName": "android.support.v4.view.AsyncLayoutInflater", "ClassDesc": "Helper class for inflating layouts asynchronously. To use, construct an instance of @B_android#support#v4#view#AsyncLayoutInflater_E@ on the UI thread and call @B_android#support#v4#view#AsyncLayoutInflater#inflate_E@. The @B_android#support#v4#view#AsyncLayoutInflater#OnInflateFinishedListener_E@ will be invoked on the UI thread when the inflate request has completed. This is intended for parts of the UI that are created lazily or in response to user interactions. This allows the UI thread to continue to be responsive & animate while the relatively heavy inflate is being performed. For a layout to be inflated asynchronously it needs to have a parent whose https:##developer#android#com@B_android#view#ViewGroup#generateLayoutParams_E@ is thread-safe and all the Views being constructed as part of inflation must not create any https:##developer#android#com@B_android#os#Handler_E@s or otherwise call https:##developer#android#com@B_android#os#Looper#myLooper_E@. If the layout that is trying to be inflated cannot be constructed asynchronously for whatever reason, @B_android#support#v4#view#AsyncLayoutInflater_E@ will automatically fall back to inflating on the UI thread. NOTE that the inflated View hierarchy is NOT added to the parent. It is equivalent to calling https:##developer#android#com@B_android#view#LayoutInflater#inflate_E@ with attachToRoot set to false. Callers will likely want to call https:##developer#android#com@B_android#view#ViewGroup#addView_E@ in the @B_android#support#v4#view#AsyncLayoutInflater#OnInflateFinishedListener_E@ callback at a minimum. This inflater does not support setting a https:##developer#android#com@B_android#view#LayoutInflater#Factory_E@ nor https:##developer#android#com@B_android#view#LayoutInflater#Factory2_E@. Similarly it does not support inflating layouts that contain fragments."}
