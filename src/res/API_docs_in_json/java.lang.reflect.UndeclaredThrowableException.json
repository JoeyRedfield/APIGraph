An UndeclaredThrowableException instance contains the undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation handler, and it can be retrieved with the getUndeclaredThrowable() method. UndeclaredThrowableException extends RuntimeException, so it is an unchecked exception that wraps a checked exception. As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism. The \"undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation handler\" that may be provided at construction time and accessed via the @B_java#lang#reflect#UndeclaredThrowableException#getUndeclaredThrowable_E@ method is now known as the @B_java#lang#Throwable#getCause_E@ method, as well as the aforementioned \"legacy method.\""}
