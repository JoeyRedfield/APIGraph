Warnings are silently chained to the object whose method caused it to be reported. Warnings may be retrieved from Connection, Statement, and ResultSet objects. Trying to retrieve a warning on a connection after it has been closed will cause an exception to be thrown. Similarly, trying to retrieve a warning on a statement after it has been closed or on a result set after it has been closed will cause an exception to be thrown. Note that closing a statement also closes a result set that it might have produced."}
