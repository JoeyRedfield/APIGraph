{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.os.health.PidHealthStats", "ClassDesc": "Keys for @B_android#os#health#HealthStats_E@ returned from @B_android#os#health#HealthStats#getStats_E@ with the @B_android#os#health#UidHealthStats#STATS_PIDS_E@ key. The values coming from PidHealthStats are a little bit different from the other HealthStats values. These values are not aggregate or historical values, but instead live values from when the snapshot is taken. These tend to be more useful in debugging rogue processes than in gathering aggregate metrics across the fleet of devices."}
