Subclasses of Transition should override this method. The method should only be called by the transition system; it is not intended to be called from external classes. This method is called by the transition's parent (all the way up to the topmost Transition in the hierarchy) with the sceneRoot and start/end values that the transition may need to set up initial target values and construct an appropriate animation. For example, if an overall Transition is a @B_android#transition#TransitionSet_E@ consisting of several child transitions in sequence, then some of the child transitions may want to set initial values on target views prior to the overall Transition commencing, to put them in an appropriate state for the delay between that start and the child Transition start time. For example, a transition that fades an item in may wish to set the starting alpha value to 0, to avoid it blinking in prior to the transition actually starting the animation. This is necessary because the scene change that triggers the Transition will automatically set the end-scene on all target views, so a Transition that wants to animate from a different value should set that value prior to returning from this method. Additionally, a Transition can perform logic to determine whether the transition needs to run on the given target and start/end values. For example, a transition that resizes objects on the screen may wish to avoid running for views which are not present in either the start or end scenes. If there is an animator created and returned from this method, the transition mechanism will apply any applicable duration, startDelay, and interpolator to that animation and start it. A return value of null indicates that no animation should run. The default implementation returns null.
