Applications implement subclasses of Class loaders may typically be used by security managers to indicate security domains. The Class loaders that support concurrent loading of classes are known as parallel capable class loaders and are required to register themselves at their class initialization time by invoking the @B_java#lang#ClassLoader#registerAsParallelCapable_E@ method. Note that the In environments in which the delegation model is not strictly hierarchical, class loaders need to be parallel capable, otherwise class loading can lead to deadlocks because the loader lock is held for the duration of the class loading process (see @B_java#lang#ClassLoader#loadClass_E@ methods). Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file system in a platform-dependent manner. For example, on UNIX systems, the virtual machine loads classes from the directory defined by the However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an application. The method @B_java#lang#ClassLoader#defineClass_E@ converts an array of bytes into an instance of class @B_java#lang#Class#newInstance_E@. The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may reference other classes. To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java virtual machine invokes the @B_java#lang#ClassLoader#loadClass_E@ method of the class loader that originally created the class. For example, an application could create a network class loader to download class files from a server. Sample code might look like: The network class loader subclass must define the methods @B_java#lang#ClassLoader#findClass_E@ and @B_java#lang#ClassLoader#defineClass_E@ to create a class instance. A sample implementation is: Any class name provided as a @B_java#lang#String_E@ parameter to methods in Examples of valid class names include:"}
