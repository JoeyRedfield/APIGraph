This class comforms to the generic grammar and formatting rules outlined in the The following rules are used throughout this specification to describe basic parsing constructs. The US-ASCII coded character set is defined by ANSI X3.4-1986. Many HTTP/1.1 header field values consist of words separated by LWS or special characters. These special characters MUST be in a quoted string to be used within a parameter value (as defined in section 3.6). A string of text is parsed as a single word if it is quoted using double-quote marks. The backslash character (\"\\\") MAY be used as a single-character quoting mechanism only within quoted-string and comment constructs. Parameters are in the form of attribute/value pairs."}
