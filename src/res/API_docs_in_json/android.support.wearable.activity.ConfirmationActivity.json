There are three types of confirmations: Success: the action was completed successfully on the wearable. Failure: the action failed to complete. Open on Phone: the action has caused something to display on the phone, or in order to complete the action, the user will need to go to their phone to continue. It is the responsibility of the wearable application developer to determine whether the action has succeeded, failed, or requires the user to go to their phone, and trigger the appropriate confirmation. To configure the confirmation according to the result of the action, set the extra https:##developer#android#com@B_android#support#wearable#activity#ConfirmationActivity#EXTRA_ANIMATION_TYPE_E@ to one of the following values: https:##developer#android#com@B_android#support#wearable#activity#ConfirmationActivity#EXTRA_MESSAGE_E@ will be displayed horizontally centered below the animation."}
