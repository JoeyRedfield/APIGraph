This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application.

However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.

AudioAttributes supersede the notion of stream types (see for instance @B_android#media#AudioManager#STREAM_MUSIC_E@ or @B_android#media#AudioManager#STREAM_ALARM_E@) for defining the behavior of audio playback. Attributes allow an application to specify more information than is conveyed in a stream type by allowing the application to define: usage: \"why\" you are playing a sound, what is this sound used for. This is achieved with the \"usage\" information. Examples of usage are @B_android#media#AudioAttributes#USAGE_MEDIA_E@ and @B_android#media#AudioAttributes#USAGE_ALARM_E@. These two examples are the closest to stream types, but more detailed use cases are available. Usage information is more expressive than a stream type, and allows certain platforms or routing policies to use this information for more refined volume or routing decisions. Usage is the most important information to supply in AudioAttributes and it is recommended to build any instance with this information supplied, see @B_android#media#AudioAttributes#Builder_E@ for exceptions. content type: \"what\" you are playing. The content type expresses the general category of the content. This information is optional. But in case it is known (for instance @B_android#media#AudioAttributes#CONTENT_TYPE_MOVIE_E@ for a movie streaming service or @B_android#media#AudioAttributes#CONTENT_TYPE_MUSIC_E@ for a music playback application) this information might be used by the audio framework to selectively configure some audio post-processing blocks. flags: \"how\" is playback to be affected, see the flag definitions for the specific playback behaviors they control.
