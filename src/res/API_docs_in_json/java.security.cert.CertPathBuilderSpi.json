A PKIX implementation returns objects of type PKIXRevocationChecker. The primary purpose of this method is to allow callers to specify additional input parameters and options specific to revocation checking. See the class description of CertPathBuilder for an example.

All CertPathBuilder implementations must include a class (the SPI class) that extends this class (CertPathBuilderSpi) and implements all of its methods. In general, instances of this class should only be accessed through the CertPathBuilder class. For details, see the Java Cryptography Architecture. Instances of this class need not be protected against concurrent access from multiple threads. Threads that need to access a single CertPathBuilderSpi instance concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking before calling the wrapping CertPathBuilder object. However, implementations of CertPathBuilderSpi may still encounter concurrency issues, since multiple threads each manipulating a different CertPathBuilderSpi instance need not synchronize."}
