As stated in the documentation for @B_android#view#View#LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE_E@, the actual type of layer used internally depends on the runtime situation of the view.

If the activity or the view is not accelerated, then the layer will effectively be the same as @B_android#view#View#LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE_E@. This state is not persistent, either on the View or on this ViewPropertyAnimator: the layer type of the View will be restored when the animation ends to what it was when this method was called, and this setting on ViewPropertyAnimator is only valid for the next animation. Note that calling this method and then independently setting the layer type of the View (by a direct call to @B_android#view#View#setLayerType_E@) will result in some inconsistency, including having the layer type restored to its pre-withLayer() value when the animation ends. For API 14 and 15, this method will run by setting a listener on the ViewPropertyAnimatorCompat object, setting a hardware layer in the listener's @B_android#support#v4#view#ViewPropertyAnimatorListener#onAnimationStart_E@ method, and then restoring the orignal layer type in the listener's @B_android#support#v4#view#ViewPropertyAnimatorListener#onAnimationEnd_E@ method.", "history": "added in version 22.0.0", "FullName": "ViewPropertyAnimatorCompat withLayer ()"}, "translationXBy(float)": {"Returns": [["@B_android#support#v4#view#ViewPropertyAnimatorCompat_E@", "This object, allowing calls to methods in this class to be chained."]], "Parameters": [["float", "float: The amount to be animated by, as an offset from the current value."]], "Throws": [], "SeeAlso": [], "Permissions": [], "Description": "This method will cause the View's translationX property to be animated by the specified value.
