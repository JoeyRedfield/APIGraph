{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "java.security.spec.KeySpec", "ClassDesc": "A (transparent) specification of the key material that constitutes a cryptographic key. If the key is stored on a hardware device, its specification may contain information that helps identify the key on the device. A key may be specified in an algorithm-specific way, or in an algorithm-independent encoding format (such as ASN.1). For example, a DSA private key may be specified by its components x, p, q, and g (see @B_java#security#spec#DSAPrivateKeySpec_E@), or it may be specified using its DER encoding (see @B_java#security#spec#PKCS8EncodedKeySpec_E@). This interface contains no methods or constants. Its only purpose is to group (and provide type safety for) all key specifications. All key specifications must implement this interface."}
