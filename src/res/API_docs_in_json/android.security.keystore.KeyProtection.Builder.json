The formal cryptographic property being required is indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA). This property is important because it mitigates several classes of weaknesses due to which ciphertext may leak information about plaintext. For example, if a given plaintext always produces the same ciphertext, an attacker may see the repeated ciphertexts and be able to deduce something about the plaintext. By default, IND-CPA is required. When IND-CPA is required: transformation which do not offer IND-CPA, such as symmetric ciphers using ECB mode or RSA encryption without padding, are prohibited; in transformations which use an IV, such as symmetric ciphers in GCM, CBC, and CTR block modes, caller-provided IVs are rejected when encrypting, to ensure that only random IVs are used. Before disabling this requirement, consider the following approaches instead: If you are generating a random IV for encryption and then initializing a Cipher using the IV, the solution is to let the Cipher generate a random IV instead. This will occur if the Cipher is initialized for encryption without an IV. The IV can then be queried via @B_javax#crypto#Cipher#getIV_E@. If you are generating a non-random IV (e.g., an IV derived from something not fully random, such as the name of the file being encrypted, or transaction ID, or password, or a device identifier), consider changing your design to use a random IV which will then be provided in addition to the ciphertext to the entities which need to decrypt the ciphertext.
