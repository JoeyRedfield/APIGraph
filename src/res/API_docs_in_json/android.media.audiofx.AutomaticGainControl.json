Automatic Gain Control (AGC) is an audio pre-processor which automatically normalizes the output of the captured signal by boosting or lowering input from the microphone to match a preset level so that the output signal level is virtually constant. AGC can be used by applications where the input signal dynamic range is not important but where a constant strong capture level is desired. An application creates a AutomaticGainControl object to instantiate and control an AGC engine in the audio framework. To attach the AutomaticGainControl to a particular @B_android#media#AudioRecord_E@, specify the audio session ID of this AudioRecord when creating the AutomaticGainControl. The audio session is retrieved by calling @B_android#media#AudioRecord#getAudioSessionId_E@ on the AudioRecord instance. On some devices, an AGC can be inserted by default in the capture path by the platform according to the @B_android#media#MediaRecorder#AudioSource_E@ used. The application should call AutomaticGainControl.getEnable() after creating the AGC to check the default AGC activation state on a particular AudioRecord session. See @B_android#media#audiofx#AudioEffect_E@ class for more details on controlling audio effects."}
