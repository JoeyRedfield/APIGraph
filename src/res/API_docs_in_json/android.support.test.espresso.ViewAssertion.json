{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.support.test.espresso.ViewAssertion", "ClassDesc": "Responsible for performing assertions on a View element. This is considered part of the test framework public API - developers are free to write their own assertions as long as they meet the following requirements: Do not mutate the passed in view. Throw junit.framework.AssertionError when the view assertion does not hold. Implementation runs on the UI thread - so it should not do any blocking operations Downcasting the view to a specific type is allowed, provided there is a test that view is an instance of that type before downcasting. If not, an AssertionError should be thrown. It is encouraged to access non-mutating methods on the view to perform assertion. Strongly consider using a existing ViewAssertion via the ViewAssertions utility class before writing your own assertion."}
