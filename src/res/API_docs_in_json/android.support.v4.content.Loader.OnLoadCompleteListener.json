{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.support.v4.content.Loader.OnLoadCompleteListener<D>", "ClassDesc": "Interface that is implemented to discover when a Loader has finished loading its data. You do not normally need to implement this yourself; it is used in the implementation of @B_android#support#v4#app#LoaderManager_E@ to find out when a Loader it is managing has completed so that this can be reported to its client. This interface should only be used if a Loader is not being used in conjunction with LoaderManager."}
