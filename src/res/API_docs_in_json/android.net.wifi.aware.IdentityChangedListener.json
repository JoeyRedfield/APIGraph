Change may be due to device joining a cluster, starting a cluster, or discovery interface change (addresses are randomized at regular intervals). The implication is that peers you've been communicating with may no longer recognize you and you need to re-establish your identity - e.g. by starting a discovery session. This actual MAC address of the interface may also be useful if the application uses alternative (non-Aware) discovery but needs to set up a Aware connection. The provided Aware discovery interface MAC address can then be used in @B_android#net#wifi#aware#WifiAwareSession#createNetworkSpecifierOpen_E@ or @B_android#net#wifi#aware#WifiAwareSession#createNetworkSpecifierPassphrase_E@."}
