{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.provider.Contacts", "ClassDesc": "The APIs have been superseded by @B_android#provider#ContactsContract_E@. The newer APIs allow access multiple accounts and support aggregation of similar contacts. These APIs continue to work but will only return data for the first Google account created, which matches the original behavior. The Contacts provider stores all information about contacts."}
