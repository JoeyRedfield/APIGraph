The media router obtains a route controller for a route whenever it needs to control a route. When a route is selected, the media router invokes the @B_android#support#v7#media#MediaRouteProvider#RouteController#onSelect_E@ method of its route controller. While selected, the media router may call other methods of the route controller to request that it perform certain actions to the route. When a route is unselected, the media router invokes the @B_android#support#v7#media#MediaRouteProvider#RouteController#onUnselect_E@ method of its route controller. When the media route no longer needs the route controller it will invoke the @B_android#support#v7#media#MediaRouteProvider#RouteController#onRelease_E@ method to allow the route controller to free its resources. There may be multiple route controllers simultaneously active for the same route. Each route controller will be released separately. All operations on the route controller are asynchronous and results are communicated via callbacks."}
