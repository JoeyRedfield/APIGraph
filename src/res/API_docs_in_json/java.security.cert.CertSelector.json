Classes that implement this interface are often used to specify which Certificates should be retrieved from a CertStore. Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this interface are not thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize."}
