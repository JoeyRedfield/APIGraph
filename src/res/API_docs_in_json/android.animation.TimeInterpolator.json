{"Functions": {"getInterpolation(float)": {"Returns": [["float", "The interpolation value. This value can be more than 1.0 for interpolators which overshoot their targets, or less than 0 for interpolators that undershoot their targets."]], "Parameters": [["float", "float: A value between 0 and 1.0 indicating our current point in the animation where 0 represents the start and 1.0 represents the end"]], "Throws": [], "SeeAlso": [], "Permissions": [], "Description": "Maps a value representing the elapsed fraction of an animation to a value that represents the interpolated fraction. This interpolated value is then multiplied by the change in value of an animation to derive the animated value at the current elapsed animation time.", "history": "Added in API level 11", "FullName": "public abstract float getInterpolation (float input)"}}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.animation.TimeInterpolator", "ClassDesc": "A time interpolator defines the rate of change of an animation. This allows animations to have non-linear motion, such as acceleration and deceleration."}
