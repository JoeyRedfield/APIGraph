Prior to Lollipop, there was a bug in the framework which prevented the developer to make a notification dismissable again after having used the same notification as the ongoing notification for a foreground service. When the notification was posted by @B_android#app#Service#startForeground_E@, but then the service exited foreground mode via @B_android#app#Service#stopForeground_E@, without removing the notification, the notification stayed ongoing, and thus not dismissable. This is a common scenario for media notifications, as this is exactly the service lifecycle that happens when playing/pausing media. Thus, a workaround is provided by the support library: Instead of making the notification ongoing depending on the playback state, the support library provides the ability to add an explicit cancel button to the notification. Note that the notification is enforced to be ongoing if a cancel button is shown to provide a consistent user experience. Also note that this method is a no-op when running on Lollipop and later.", "history": "added in version 24.2.0", "FullName": "NotificationCompat.MediaStyle setShowCancelButton (boolean show)"}, "setCancelButtonIntent(android.app.PendingIntent)": {"Returns": [["@B_android#support#v7#app#NotificationCompat#MediaStyle_E@", "no returns description in source"]], "Parameters": [["@B_android#app#PendingIntent_E@", "PendingIntent: the intent to be sent when the cancel button is pressed"]], "Throws": [], "SeeAlso": [], "Permissions": [], "Description": "Sets the pending intent to be sent when the cancel button is pressed.
