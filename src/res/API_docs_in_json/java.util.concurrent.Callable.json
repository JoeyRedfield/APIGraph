Implementors define a single method with no arguments called call. The Callable interface is similar to @B_java#lang#Runnable_E@, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread. A Runnable, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception. The @B_java#util#concurrent#Executors_E@ class contains utility methods to convert from other common forms to Callable classes."}
