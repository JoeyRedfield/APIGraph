An attempt is made to read up to Suppose that a byte sequence of length A read operation might not fill the buffer, and in fact it might not read any bytes at all. Whether or not it does so depends upon the nature and state of the channel. A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot read any more bytes than are immediately available from the socket's input buffer; similarly, a file channel cannot read any more bytes than remain in the file. It is guaranteed, however, that if a channel is in blocking mode and there is at least one byte remaining in the buffer then this method will block until at least one byte is read. This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an invocation of this method will block until the first operation is complete.", "history": "Added in API level 1", "FullName": "public abstract int read (ByteBuffer dst)"}}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "java.nio.channels.ReadableByteChannel", "ClassDesc": "A channel that can read bytes.

Whether or not other kinds of I/O operations may proceed concurrently with a read operation depends upon the type of the channel."}
