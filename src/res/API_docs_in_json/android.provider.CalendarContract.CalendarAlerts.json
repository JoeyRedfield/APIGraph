{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.provider.CalendarContract.CalendarAlerts", "ClassDesc": "Fields and helpers for accessing calendar alerts information. These fields are for tracking which alerts have been fired. Scheduled alarms will generate an intent using @B_android#provider#CalendarContract#ACTION_EVENT_REMINDER_E@. Apps that receive this action may update the @B_android#provider#CalendarContract#CalendarAlertsColumns#STATE_E@ for the reminder when they have finished handling it. Apps that have their notifications disabled should not modify the table to ensure that they do not conflict with another app that is generating a notification. In general, apps should not need to write to this table directly except to update the state of a reminder."}
