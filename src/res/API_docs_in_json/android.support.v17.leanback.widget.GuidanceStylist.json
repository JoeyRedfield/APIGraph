Subclasses may wish to override the @B_android#support#v17#leanback#widget#GuidanceStylist#onProvideLayoutId_E@ method to change the layout file used to display the guidance; more complex layouts may be supported by also providing a subclass of @B_android#support#v17#leanback#widget#GuidanceStylist#Guidance_E@ with extra fields.
