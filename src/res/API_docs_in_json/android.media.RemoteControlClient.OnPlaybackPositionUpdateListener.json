If the position can be changed from its current value, the implementor of the interface must also update the playback position using @B_android#media#RemoteControlClient#setPlaybackState_E@ to reflect the actual new position being used, regardless of whether it differs from the requested position. Failure to do so would cause the system to not know the new actual playback position, and user interface components would fail to show the user where playback resumed after the position was updated.", "history": "Added in API level 18 Deprecated in API level 29", "FullName": "public abstract void onPlaybackPositionUpdate (long newPositionMs)"}}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.media.RemoteControlClient.OnPlaybackPositionUpdateListener", "ClassDesc": "Interface definition for a callback to be invoked when the media playback position is requested to be updated."}
