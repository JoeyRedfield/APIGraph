This is called after @B_android#app#Fragment#onAttach_E@ and before @B_android#app#Fragment#onCreateView_E@, but is not called if the fragment instance is retained across Activity re-creation (see @B_android#app#Fragment#setRetainInstance_E@). Note that this can be called while the fragment's activity is still in the process of being created. As such, you can not rely on things like the activity's content view hierarchy being initialized at this point. If you want to do work once the activity itself is created, see @B_android#app#Fragment#onActivityCreated_E@. If your app's targetSdkVersion is @B_android#os#Build#VERSION_CODES#M_E@ or lower, child fragments being restored from the savedInstanceState are restored after onCreate returns. When targeting @B_android#os#Build#VERSION_CODES#N_E@ or above and running on an N or newer platform version they are restored by Fragment.onCreate.", "history": "", "FullName": "void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState)"}}, "Inheritance": ["java.lang.Object", "https:##developer#android#com@B_android#app#Fragment_E@"], "ClassName": "android.support.v17.preference.LeanbackPreferenceDialogFragment", "ClassDesc": ""}
