{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": ["java.lang.Object"], "ClassName": "com.google.android.gms.cast.Cast", "ClassDesc": "Main entry point for the Cast APIs. This class provides APIs and interfaces to access Google Cast devices. To use the service, construct a @B_com#google#android#gms#common#api#GoogleApiClient#Builder_E@ and pass @B_com#google#android#gms#cast#Cast#API_E@ to @B_com#google#android#gms#common#api#GoogleApiClient#Builder#addApi_E@. Once you have your @B_com#google#android#gms#common#api#GoogleApiClient_E@, call @B_com#google#android#gms#common#api#GoogleApiClient#connect_E@ and wait for the @B_com#google#android#gms#common#api#GoogleApiClient#ConnectionCallbacks#onConnected_E@ method to be called. Device discovery on Android is performed using the Android MediaRouter APIs that debuted in Jellybean MR2 (API level 18). The MediaRouter APIs are implemented in the Android v7 Support Library. These APIs provide a simple mechanism for discovering media destinations, such as Chromecasts, bluetooth speakers, Android-powered smart TVs, and other media playback devices; and for routing media content to and controlling playback on those endpoints. These endpoints are referred to as \u201cmedia routes.\u201d"}
