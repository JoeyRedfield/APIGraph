Java-specific class for dynamically loading SAX parsers. @B_org#xml#sax#Parser_E@ class. SAX2 applications should use @B_org#xml#sax#helpers#XMLReaderFactory_E@ instead. ParserFactory is not part of the platform-independent definition of SAX; it is an additional convenience class designed specifically for Java XML application writers. SAX applications can use the static methods in this class to allocate a SAX parser dynamically at run-time based either on the value of the `org.xml.sax.parser' system property or on a string containing the class name. Note that the application still requires an XML parser that implements SAX1."}
