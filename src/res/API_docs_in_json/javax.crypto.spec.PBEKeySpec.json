Different PBE mechanisms may consume different bits of each password character. For example, the PBE mechanism defined in You convert the password characters to a PBE key by creating an instance of the appropriate secret-key factory. For example, a secret-key factory for PKCS #5 will construct a PBE key from only the low order 8 bits of each password character, whereas a secret-key factory for PKCS #12 will take all 16 bits of each character. Also note that this class stores passwords as char arrays instead of String objects (which would seem more logical), because the String class is immutable and there is no way to overwrite its internal value when the password stored in it is no longer needed. Hence, this class requests the password as a char array, so it can be overwritten when done."}
