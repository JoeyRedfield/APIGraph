{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.databinding.DataBindingComponent", "ClassDesc": "This interface is generated during compilation to contain getters for all used instance BindingAdapters. When a BindingAdapter is an instance method, an instance of the class implementing the method must be instantiated. This interface will be generated with a getter for each class with the name get* where * is simple class name of the declaring BindingAdapter class/interface. Name collisions will be resolved by adding a numeric suffix to the getter. An instance of this class may also be passed into static or instance BindingAdapters as the first parameter. If using Dagger 2, the developer should extend this interface and annotate the extended interface as a Component."}
