Using thread factories removes hardwiring of calls to @B_java#lang#Thread#Thread_E@, enabling applications to use special thread subclasses, priorities, etc. The simplest implementation of this interface is just: @B_java#util#concurrent#Executors#defaultThreadFactory_E@ method provides a more useful simple implementation, that sets the created thread context to known values before returning it."}
