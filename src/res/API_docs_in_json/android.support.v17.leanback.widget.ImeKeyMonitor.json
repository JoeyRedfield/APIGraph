{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.support.v17.leanback.widget.ImeKeyMonitor", "ClassDesc": "Interface for an EditText subclass that can delegate calls to onKeyPreIme up to a registered listener. Used in editable actions within @B_android#support#v17#leanback#app#GuidedStepFragment_E@ to allow for custom back key handling. Specifically, this is used to implement the behavior that dismissing the IME also clears edit text focus. Clients who need to supply custom layouts for @B_android#support#v17#leanback#widget#GuidedActionsStylist_E@ with their own EditText classes should satisfy this interface in order to inherit this behavior."}
