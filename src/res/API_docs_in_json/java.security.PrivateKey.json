{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "java.security.PrivateKey", "ClassDesc": "A private key. The purpose of this interface is to group (and provide type safety for) all private key interfaces. Note: The specialized private key interfaces extend this interface. See, for example, the DSAPrivateKey interface in @B_java#security#interfaces#package-summary_E@. Implementations should override the default destroy and isDestroyed methods from the @B_javax#security#auth#Destroyable_E@ interface to enable sensitive key information to be destroyed, cleared, or in the case where such information is immutable, unreferenced. Finally, since PrivateKey is Serializable, implementations should also override @B_java#io#ObjectOutputStream#writeObject_E@ to prevent keys that have been destroyed from being serialized."}
