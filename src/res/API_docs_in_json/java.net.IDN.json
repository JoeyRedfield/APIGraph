Internationalized domain names can use characters from the entire range of Unicode, while traditional domain names are restricted to ASCII characters. ACE is an encoding of Unicode strings that uses only ASCII characters and can be used with software (such as the Domain Name System) that only understands traditional domain names. Internationalized domain names are defined in The behavior of aforementioned conversion process can be adjusted by various flags: If the ALLOW_UNASSIGNED flag is used, the domain name string to be converted can contain code points that are unassigned in Unicode 3.2, which is the Unicode version on which IDN conversion is based. If the flag is not used, the presence of such unassigned code points is treated as an error. If the USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES flag is used, ASCII strings are checked against These flags can be logically OR'ed together. The security consideration is important with respect to internationalization domain name support. For example, English domain names may be"}
