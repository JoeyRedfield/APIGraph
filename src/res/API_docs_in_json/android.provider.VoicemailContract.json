{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.provider.VoicemailContract", "ClassDesc": "The contract between the voicemail provider and applications. Contains definitions for the supported URIs and columns. The content providers exposes two tables through this interface: Voicemails table: This stores the actual voicemail records. The columns and URIs for accessing this table are defined by the @B_android#provider#VoicemailContract#Voicemails_E@ class. Status table: This provides a way for the voicemail source application to convey its current state to the system. The columns and URIS for accessing this table are defined by the @B_android#provider#VoicemailContract#Status_E@ class. The minimum permission needed to access this content provider is @B_android#Manifest#permission#ADD_VOICEMAIL_E@ or carrier privileges (see @B_android#telephony#TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges_E@). Voicemails are inserted by what is called as a \"voicemail source\" application, which is responsible for syncing voicemail data between a remote server and the local voicemail content provider. \"voicemail source\" application should always set the @B_android#provider#VoicemailContract#PARAM_KEY_SOURCE_PACKAGE_E@ in the URI to identify its package. In addition to the @B_android#database#ContentObserver_E@ notifications the voicemail provider also generates broadcast intents to notify change for applications that are not active and therefore cannot listen to ContentObserver notifications. Broadcast intents with following actions are generated: @B_android#provider#VoicemailContract#ACTION_NEW_VOICEMAIL_E@ is generated for each new voicemail inserted. @B_android#content#Intent#ACTION_PROVIDER_CHANGED_E@ is generated for any change made into the database, including new voicemail."}
