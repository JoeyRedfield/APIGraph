{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.icu.lang.UProperty", "ClassDesc": "Selection constants for Unicode properties. These constants are used in functions like UCharacter.hasBinaryProperty(int) to select one of the Unicode properties. The properties APIs are intended to reflect Unicode properties as defined in the Unicode Character Database (UCD) and Unicode Technical Reports (UTR). For details about the properties see Important: If ICU is built with UCD files from Unicode versions below 3.2, then properties marked with \"new\" are not or not fully available. Check UCharacter.getUnicodeVersion() to be sure."}
