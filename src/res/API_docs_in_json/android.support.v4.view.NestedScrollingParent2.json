Perform cleanup after a nested scrolling operation. This method will be called when a nested scroll stops, for example when a nested touch scroll ends with a @B_android#view#MotionEvent#ACTION_UP_E@ or @B_android#view#MotionEvent#ACTION_CANCEL_E@ event. Implementations of this method should always call their superclass's implementation of this method if one is present.", "history": "added in version 26.0.0-beta2", "FullName": "void onStopNestedScroll (View target, int type)"}}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.support.v4.view.NestedScrollingParent2", "ClassDesc": "This interface should be implemented by https:##developer#android#com@B_android#view#ViewGroup_E@ subclasses that wish to support scrolling operations delegated by a nested child view. Classes implementing this interface should create a final instance of a @B_android#support#v4#view#NestedScrollingParentHelper_E@ as a field and delegate any View or ViewGroup methods to the NestedScrollingParentHelper methods of the same signature. Views invoking nested scrolling functionality should always do so from the relevant @B_android#support#v4#view#ViewCompat_E@, @B_android#support#v4#view#ViewGroupCompat_E@ or @B_android#support#v4#view#ViewParentCompat_E@ compatibility shim static methods. This ensures interoperability with nested scrolling views on all versions of Android."}
