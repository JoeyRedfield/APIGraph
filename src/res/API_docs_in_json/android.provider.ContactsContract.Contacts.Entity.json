{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.provider.ContactsContract.Contacts.Entity", "ClassDesc": "A sub-directory of a contact that contains all of its @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#RawContacts_E@ as well as @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#Data_E@ rows. To access this directory append @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#Contacts#Entity#CONTENT_DIRECTORY_E@ to the contact URI. Entity has three ID fields: @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#RawContactsColumns#CONTACT_ID_E@ for the contact, @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#Contacts#Entity#RAW_CONTACT_ID_E@ for the raw contact and @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#Contacts#Entity#DATA_ID_E@ for the data rows. Entity always contains at least one row per constituent raw contact, even if there are no actual data rows. In this case the @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#Contacts#Entity#DATA_ID_E@ field will be null. Entity reads all data for the entire contact in one transaction, to guarantee consistency. There is significant data duplication in the Entity (each row repeats all Contact columns and all RawContact columns), so the benefits of transactional consistency should be weighed against the cost of transferring large amounts of denormalized data from the Provider. To reduce the amount of data duplication the contacts provider and directory providers implementing this protocol are allowed to provide common Contacts and RawContacts fields in the first row returned for each raw contact only and leave them as null in subsequent rows."}
