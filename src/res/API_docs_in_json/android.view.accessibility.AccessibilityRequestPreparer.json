Registering an instance of this class with @B_android#view#accessibility#AccessibilityManager_E@ allows a View to be notified when a request is about to be made, and to asynchronously inform the accessibility system when it is ready to meet the request. @B_android#view#View_E@ cannot otherwise synchronously meet the request for accessibility data."}
