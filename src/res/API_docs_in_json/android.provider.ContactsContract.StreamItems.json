In the future, cursors returned from related queries will be empty. Constants for the stream_items table, which contains social stream updates from the user's contact list. Only a certain number of stream items will ever be stored under a given raw contact. Users of this API can query @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#StreamItems#CONTENT_LIMIT_URI_E@ to determine this limit, and should restrict the number of items inserted in any given transaction correspondingly. Insertion of more items beyond the limit will automatically lead to deletion of the oldest items, by @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#StreamItemsColumns#TIMESTAMP_E@. Access to the social stream through these URIs requires additional permissions beyond the read/write contact permissions required by the provider. Querying for social stream data requires android.permission.READ_SOCIAL_STREAM permission, and inserting or updating social stream items requires android.permission.WRITE_SOCIAL_STREAM permission. The content URIs to the insert, update and delete operations are required to have the account information matching that of the owning raw contact as query parameters, namely @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#SyncColumns#ACCOUNT_TYPE_E@ and @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#SyncColumns#ACCOUNT_NAME_E@. @B_android#provider#ContactsContract#RawContactsColumns#DATA_SET_E@ isn't required."}
