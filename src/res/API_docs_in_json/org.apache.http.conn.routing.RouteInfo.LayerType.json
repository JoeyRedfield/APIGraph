Plain routes are established by connecting or tunnelling. Layered routes are established by layering a protocol such as TLS/SSL over an existing connection. Protocols can only be layered over a tunnel to the target, or or over a direct connection without proxies. Layering a protocol over a direct connection makes little sense, since the connection could be established with the new protocol in the first place. But we don't want to exclude that use case."}
