It works using the https:##developer#android#com@B_android#view#ViewGroup#getChildDrawingOrder_E@ method, so any case that applies to that method also applies to this callback. For example, changing the drawing order of two views will not have any effect if their elevation values are different since elevation overrides the result of this callback."}
