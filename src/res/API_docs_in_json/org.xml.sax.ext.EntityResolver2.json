Documents with DOCTYPE declarations that omit an external subset can thus augment the declarations available for validation, entity processing, and attribute processing (normalization, defaulting, and reporting types including ID). This augmentation is reported through the @B_org#xml#sax#ext#LexicalHandler#startDTD_E@ method as if the document text had originally included the external subset; this callback is made before any internal subset data or errors are reported. This method can also be used with documents that have no DOCTYPE declaration. When the root element is encountered, but no DOCTYPE declaration has been seen, this method is invoked. If it returns a value for the external subset, that root element is declared to be the root element, giving the effect of splicing a DOCTYPE declaration at the end the prolog of a document that could not otherwise be valid. The sequence of parser callbacks in that case logically resembles this: Note that the InputSource gets no further resolution. Implementations of this method may wish to invoke @B_org#xml#sax#EntityResolver#resolveEntity_E@ to gain benefits such as use of local caches of DTD entities. Also, this method will never be used by a (non-validating) processor that is not including external parameter entities. Uses for this method include facilitating data validation when interoperating with XML processors that would always require undesirable network accesses for external entities, or which for other reasons adopt a \"no DTDs\" policy. Non-validation motives include forcing documents to include DTDs so that attributes are handled consistently. For example, an XPath processor needs to know which attibutes have type \"ID\" before it can process a widely used type of reference.", "history": "Added in API level 1", "FullName": "public abstract InputSource getExternalSubset (String name, String baseURI)"}, "resolveEntity(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)": {"Returns": [["@B_org#xml#sax#InputSource_E@", "An InputSource object describing the new input source to be used by the parser.

The @B_org#xml#sax#XMLReader#setEntityResolver_E@ method is used to provide implementations of this interface to parsers. When a parser uses the methods in this interface, the @B_org#xml#sax#EntityResolver#resolveEntity_E@ method (in this interface) is used instead of the older (SAX 1.0) @B_org#xml#sax#EntityResolver#resolveEntity_E@ method. If a SAX application requires the customized handling which this interface defines for external entities, it must ensure that it uses an XMLReader with the http://xml.org/sax/features/use-entity-resolver2 feature flag set to true (which is its default value when the feature is recognized). If that flag is unrecognized, or its value is false, or the resolver does not implement this interface, then only the @B_org#xml#sax#EntityResolver_E@ method will be used. That supports three categories of application that modify entity resolution. Old Style applications won't know about this interface; they will provide an EntityResolver. Transitional Mode provide an EntityResolver2 and automatically get the benefit of its methods in any systems (parsers or other tools) supporting it, due to polymorphism. Both Old Style and Transitional Mode applications will work with any SAX2 parser. New style applications will fail to run except on SAX2 parsers that support this particular feature. They will insist that feature flag have a value of \"true\", and the EntityResolver2 implementation they provide might throw an exception if the original SAX 1.0 style entity resolution method is invoked."}
